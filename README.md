# PyCascades 2025 Demo üêç üèîÔ∏è

PyCascades is a demonstration project for [PyCascades 2025](https://2025.pycascades.com/).

The project focuses on building tools for genomic research, particularly in customizing a submission process in Python for the Gen3 platform and machine learning for predicting molecular subtypes:
- Customizing a submission process for the [Gen3 Platform](https://gen3.org/)
- Predicting molecular subtypes using data tutorial with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- End-to-end data analysis and visualization
