# PyCascades
PyCascdes 2025 Demo

[Brainstorming](https://ohsucomputationalbio.slack.com/canvas/C07TZ82UVC5)
1. Potential Ideas / Components

* customizing a submission process in Python for the gen3 platform
* Data Structures for Scalable and Efficient Machine Learning (also questions that can be asked/answered). focusing on BMEG
* Combination of the above? Our current title is “Data Science Garage: Building Tools for Genomic Research”
* Can we add the new machine learning feature extraction paper in ^ . (was it done by randomForest  :melting_face:)
* Predicting molecular subtypes: data tutorial with scikit learn. Related ideas...
    * future BK paper on molecular subtyping
    * breast cancer grabbing mafs and finding most mutated genes

1. Potential Talk flow and time breakdown example


GDC BioBlend
PyGrip
Xena
cBioPortal
Prevalent mutations in cancer subtypes (e.g. most common mutation in breast cancer, hotspots across proteins)
Include AI!
Grid search of scikit-learn pipelines
End-to-end, multistep walkthrough of:

* Finding data
* Analyze data,
* Visualize data


Action Items

* Chat with Nasim about FHIR Aggregator or CDA as Python demo
* Which resources we’ll pull from?
* Which transformations?
* Which figures?
* E.g. Mutex for Cancer mutations or Machine Learning
* scikit-learn pipeline — TMP Paper (tarball with all cancers and subtypes), pandas operations to subset information and create ML model that recognizes that
    * Basal vs Luminal
    * Mutual Exclusivity Matrix (e.g. like BK has presented)
* Meet January 9th in afternoon before Nasim heads out
* Create hidden repo in ohsu-comp-bio
